I-Notebook React App
The I-Notebook React App is a web application designed to serve as a digital notebook for users. It allows users to create, store, and manage their notes securely. The app includes both frontend and backend components to provide a seamless user experience.

Features
User Authentication: The app supports user registration and login functionality. Each user has a unique set of credentials to access their notes securely.
Create and Edit Notes: Users can create new notes and edit existing ones. The app provides a user-friendly interface to compose and format notes with rich text editing capabilities.
Store Notes: The notes created by users are securely stored in the backend database, ensuring data persistence and accessibility across multiple sessions.
User-Specific Notes: Each user has their own set of notes associated with their account. This ensures privacy and organization for each user's personal notes.
Search and Filter: The app allows users to search and filter their notes based on keywords or categories, making it easy to find specific information.
Responsive Design: The frontend of the app is built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (or any preferred database system)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Styling: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI (optional)
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
